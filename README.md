- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @SneakyWhoami (Chris)
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Free software, web 1.0 renaissance, self-hosting, tinkering and portage
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on BCIs, traditional desktop applications, scratching little itches (especially the surprise ones), anti-social-networking propaganda
- üì´ How to reach me ... If you can find one of my commits on github, put `.patch` on the end of the url. Or type my name into Steam, of all things

I have about 20 years of casual experience as a programmer and home network admin, roughly 10 of which overlaps with paid, private, development and small-network (a dozen systems) administration.
I don't mean to use this as a CV, but if you need help I have experience to varying degrees (in no particular order) in:
* C++
* Javascriipt
* PHP
* Python
* C#
* Java
* Linux (inc. shell scripts etc)
* Windows (incl. powershell etc)
* DOS (and yes, batch files)
* Haiku

Notice I don't specify "C" or "Perl" - this is not a philosophical thing. C is probably the best language out there, I just tend more toward C++. I admire Perl but it's not my thing.

Mostly I fool around at home on Linux, But I have a Macbook that dualboots Windows and I'm not a big evangelist. Each of those systems is great. I have a soft spot for Haiku.

Most of my passion projects are in self-hosted Phorge (formerly Phabricator), automatically built by buildbot and bundled into apt repositories by aptly.
I have a diploma in IT and I'm just finishing up a degree in Software Engineering now. In spite of this, I always feel like an absolute noob at everything.

I use mostly Firefox right now, although I haven't felt right with it since E10S. My favourite modern web engine is Webkit. My overall favourite is KHTML.

For software that is not a complete program (eg a library, if I haven't explicitly specified a license, please accept it as LGPL-2.1 as described [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) (or any later version, if you need that).
This offer is good for any snippet or library i released before today, the 7th day of April, 2021.
Snippets less than 15 lines I release into the public domain where that is possible, or in CC0 if not.
Please do leave comments or bug reports if you'd like me to specify the license somewhere I've missed, though.


TODO: shorten this, to procrastinate even more
