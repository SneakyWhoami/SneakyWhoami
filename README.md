- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @SneakyWhoami (Chris)
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Free software, web 1.0 renaissance, self-hosting, tinkering and portage
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning RYO CI, mostly for C++ projects, and (mostly Debian) packaging
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on BCIs, traditional desktop applications, scratching little itches (especially the surprise ones), anti-social-networking propaganda
- üì´ How to reach me ... If you can find one of my commits on github, put `.patch` on the end of the url. Or type my name into Steam, of all things

I have about 20 years of casual experience as a programmer and home network admin, roughly 10 of which overlaps with paid, private, development and small-network (a dozen systems) administration.
I don't mean to use this as a CV, but if you need help I have experience to varying degrees (in no particular order) in:
* C++
* Javascriipt
* PHP
* Python
* C#
* Java
* Linux (inc. shell scripts etc)
* Windows (incl. powershell etc, kixstart scripts maybe)
* DOS (and yes, batch files)
* Haiku

Notice I don't specify "C" or "Perl" - this is not a philosophical thing. C is probably the best language out there, I just tend more toward C++. Perl I'll avoid if I can. I can hack it a little bit, but it looks like ascii art and half the time I don't know what I'm doing.

Mostly I fool around at home on Linux, But I have a Macbook that dualboots Windows and I'm not a big evangelist. Each of those systems is so ~great~ ~horrible~ .... Computers are computers, man.
I like what I like, you like what you like, maybe I like what you like a little bit. Haiku is very cool though. It's generally easy to port QT5 and SDL stuff over there, so if you're not doing [certain specific computing tasks] it's an absolutely perfect single-user system. It's pretty and it's FAST.

I've run (not hacked much) at various points Trac, Bugzilla, Mantis, Phabricator. My favourite ~among those~ might be gitea, or gitlab, or gerrit. Phabricator has so many amazing features, and is actually pretty easy to set up.
But Phabricator markdown is not fun in a Github world. The main draw of Phabricator was that it wouldn't need its own process for the web requests. As it turns out, there is a `phd` daemon to run, so that didn't work out.

Lately I've been investigating how I can get things tested, covered and packaged all at once, on premise. Phabricator can do it (but is fiddly). Travis was cool. TeamCity was very cool.Gitlab can do some stuff, I understand.
At the moment my favourite work runs through buildbot - buildbot change hooks and phabricator's `conduit` api are a wonderful combination. 
uildbot can do `pbuilder` with very little extra work (I mean, the whole package is pretty intense, but that part is quite simple).

I have a diploma in IT and I'm just finishing up a degree in Software Engineering now. In spite of this, I always feel like an absolute noob at everything.

I use mostly Firefox right now, although I haven't felt right with it since E10S. My favourite modern web engine is Webkit. My overall favourite is KHTML.
I also really like Kristal, although that's mostly just a gemini browser. Gemini is brilliant, though I feel it's a bit like Phabricator - alien markup doesn't do what we want atm.
I used to talk to people on a website (which shall not be named) where users had basically free reign with javascript/css/html on their homepages.
It could have been the particular type of audience, but I always hated the noises and videos and animations and dumb tricks...
People love that stuff, it isn't terribly modern in itself, and it's not nearly as toxic as "progressive web applications" and reinvented square wheels (how can i make a button look like a link? ABSOLUTELY DO NOT)

I'm getting a taste for putting things in packages to be managed by my package manager (aptitude mostly).
If you're like me and you want to keep Lintian _reasonably_ happy, you'll be after a license. In case I forgot to add one:
For software that is not a complete program (eg a library, if I haven't explicitly specified a license, please accept it as LGPL-2.1 as described [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) (or any later version, if you need that).
This offer is good for any snippet or library i relase before today, the 7th day of April, 2021.
Snippets less than 15 lines I release into the public domain where that is possible, or in CC0 if not.
Please do leave comments or bug reports if you'd like me to specify the license somewhere I've missed, though.
